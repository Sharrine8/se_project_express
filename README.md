**Project Description**

The project is a full-stack application built with React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, where the current repo focuses on the backend. It fetches daily weather forecasts from an API and recommends suitable clothing based on the weather conditions. Users can view a home page with clothing categories and switch temperature units between Fahrenheit and Celsius, even when not logged in. The application includes modal forms for user registration, login, and adding clothing items, where users can specify details like name, type, weather suitability, and upload photos. Clothing items are categorized by temperature ranges (e.g., hot, warm, cold) to ensure appropriate recommendations. Key components include weather cards that display current conditions and clothing suggestions, and various modal windows for user interactions.
